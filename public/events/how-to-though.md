Random thought
-----
I start writing in around late 2014, early 2015. Much of my writing at that time is around me, how to make money, how to get a good job, how to help my parents and family, a bit about friend and love. And much of them is around 2 to a few sentences within a few lines. This is due to my limited knowledge, limited experience, limited reading, and limited thoughts. And now, I’m still limited and mediocre one!

If you keep track of what you think and your memory, and write them down, you’ll see how your thought is influenced by the environment and experience and how it evolved over time. In order to have independent thought and not too bias, I think you need to experience some small portions of life, read some books, listen, and more importantly think. So how to think properly, let’s start with question what is that? and then connect with your own languages to describe it? and then ask your self why? I think that’s is a typical process of thinking?

Then, how to have an independent thinking? If you compare your current version and 5-years-ago or 10-years-ago, or even further to the old-time versions, you’ll see how are you evolving!!! We’re living in a society, having collective intelligence and understanding which is build upon others, so it’s not easy to be creative, and to have unique thoughts. There is an interesting quote from Benjamin Franklin “**Many people die at 25 and aren't buried until they are 75”.** If you’re lucky enough to live till your 75s, and keep track of some of your memory and thoughts, you’ll see how it changed magnificently, I guess! If you won’t see the change, you may not evolve, I guess again!

Comeback to the question that how to have independent thought and be creative? People often say that “Think outside of the box”! So what are inside the box, and what are outside the box? What is the box, or your barrier? I think barrier is all you the knowledge, thinking, and prejudice you are having that is processing in your head at the moment. For example, your brain is processing the words and connecting them in a complicated ways to read and think about my post. After reading this post, you may have a tiny bit of different view because I’m altering you by these words, maybe not!

Another approach is stealing some other’s idea, and then cook them by your recipe, then produce in a subtle way, then it may be an independent thought.

For me, independent thought doesn’t mean you need to go outside of the box nor improving some inside of the box. It’s the honesty from yourself, your own thought and own ideas that come from yours. Even though your ideas aren’t not really good, but that’s independent thought! And it’s not too hard to have that, I ponder?
